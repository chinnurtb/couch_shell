Couch Shell (cosh) README
=========================

Couch Shell is a command-line tool designed for proficient admins and
developers who are looking for a direct way to interact with a CouchDB
installation more efficiently:

  * Controlled by environment settings for each database
  * Requiring few keystrokes to perform common tasks
  * Allowing scripted automation of data management actions

Installation
------------

Initially, cosh is only available on Linux / UNIX operating systems.
The application is written in C.  The quickest way to install is as
follows:

  1) tar -xvf cosh-0.0.1.tgz
  2) cd cosh-0.0.1
  3) make

This will create an executable file named './cosh-0.0.1/exe/cosh'
which you can execute using a full or relative pathname.  A make
install will be provided in a future release.
